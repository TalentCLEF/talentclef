It is important to note that the data we utilize inherently excludes any personal information, focusing solely on job titles and skills without involving personal/company information or geographic location. This page contains the corpus information for TalentCLEF 2025 tasks. You can access the link to download in datasets page.\nTask A: Multilingual Job Title Matching Corpus Summary: The corpus used for Task A consists of a set of job titles in three languages: English, Spanish and German, from different job domains and professional sectors. These job titles have been collected and processed in order to facilitate the identification and comparison of equivalent titles across languages.\nThe training corpus has been generated using public terminologies, ensuring that the job titles are representative of a wide range of job domains and aligned with standard market terminology.\nOn the other hand, the validation and test corpora have been annotated by domain experts, following well-defined guidelines to ensure consistency and quality of labels. This annotation process, performed with specialized tools, included several stages of quality control to ensure that the labels were accurate and that the annotated titles accurately reflected the relationships between the different languages in a work environment.\nData:\nTraining Set: The training data is provided in a tabular format with three columns:\nid: An ESCO identifier indicating the origin of the pair’s job titles. jobtitle_1: The first job title in the pair. jobtitle_2: A second job title related to jobtitle_1. Each dataset is provided in separate files for each language involved in the task. The files are named according to the language, with the following format:\ntaskA_training_en.tsv: Contains related job titles in English. taskA_training_es.tsv: Contains related job titles in Spanish. taskA_training_de.tsv: Contains related job titles in German. An example of the content of these files is shown below:\nid jobtitle_1 jobtitle_2 http://data.europa.eu/esco/occupation/f2b15a0e-e65a-438a-affb-29b9d50b77d1 desarrollador de software desarrolladora de soluciones http://data.europa.eu/esco/occupation/f2b15a0e-e65a-438a-affb-29b9d50b77d1 desarrollador de software ingeniera de aplicaciones http://data.europa.eu/esco/occupation/d0aa0792-4345-474b-9365-686cf4869d2e diseñador de software ingeniero de software Validation Set: The validation set is structured into three diferent files: queries, corpus elements and q_rels, and is provided separately for each language.\nQueries: The queries file contains the following fields:\nq_id: A unique identifier for the query. jobtitle: The job title used as the query.

Technological advancements, such as task automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI), are reshaping the labor market by creating new roles that demand specialized skills, often difficult to source. The rise of remote hiring, fueled by technological innovation, has expanded the labor market to a global and multilingual scale. Simultaneously, social progress is narrowing ethnic and gender disparities within companies, fostering more inclusive workplaces.\nSimultaneously, there has been rapid progress in the development and deployment of language-based systems, driven in part by the creation of the Large Language Models (LLMs). These advances are revolutioning the use of tecnology in Human Capital Management (HCM) and Human Resources (HR), enabling the generation of systems able to process large volumens of data and facilitate the identification of the best candidates for specific roles based on their resumee information.\nIntegrating language technologies into HCM significantly enhances key areas. In sourcing and hiring, these tools improve candidate matching by analyzing their skills and experience. During onboarding and training, they create personalized learning materials tailored to individual employee needs. For strategic workforce planning, NLP tools predict market skill trends and future company demands. Additionally, in career development, these technologies monitor employee progress, supporting targeted upskilling and reskilling aligned with both organizational goals and personal aspirations.\nDespite all these benefits, the development and implementation of these systems present challenges such as:\nMultilingualism: The global nature of modern workforces means that companies often need to manage employees and candidates who speak multiple languages. This requires language-based systems to not only understand and process various languages accurately but also to maintain the context and cultural nuances inherent in each. Developing systems that effectively handle multiple languages is a complex task that involves significant computational resources and sophisticated NLP techniques.\nFair models: Ensuring fairness and reducing bias is a critical challenge in HCM. These systems can inadvertently perpetuate existing biases present in the data they are trained on, which can affect hiring decisions, employee evaluations, and promotions. Creating fair and unbiased models requires careful data curation, continuous monitoring, and algorithmic adjustments to mitigate biases related to gender, ethnicity, and other social factors.\nCross-Industry Adaptability: NLP systems must be flexible enough to align with the unique requirements, standards, and practices of each sector, from healthcare to technology to retail, ensuring they are effective and relevant in various contexts.\nThe first edition of TalentCLEF aims to develop and evaluate models designed to facilitate three essential tasks:\nFinding/ranking candidates for job positions based on their experience and professional skills. Implementing upskilling and reskilling strategies that promote the coninuous development of workers Detecting emerging skills and skills gaps of importance in organizations.

For each job title in a provided test set, participants must generate a ranked list of similar job titles from a specified knowledge base.\nMultilingual: Participants are required to develop systems adapted to English, Spanish, German, and optionally, Chinese.\nData: More information about data will be shown in Data section, but essentially we will provide:\nTraining Set: A collection of 15,000 pairs of related job titles per language (English, Spanish, and German), each labeled with a concept identifier, will be provided to facilitate the creation of cross-language training samples. No training data will be provided in Chinese, opening the possibility to use different techniques to improve the performance of the models in this language.\nDevelopment Set: Participants will receive a manually annotated evaluation set of 100 samples per language, consisting of a job title and its list of related job titles. A knowledge base of 2,500 job titles in each task language will also be provided for participants to generate predictions by ranking it. Additionally, cross-lingual data will be also released to allow them assess the models’ ability to operate in that scenario.\nTest set: A background set comprising 5,000 job titles will be provided. The evaluation, however, will be conducted on a subset of the background set, that will be a gold standard corpus of 100 job titles in each language annotated with the same methodology as the development set.\nEvaluation: Details about evaluation will be placed in Evaluation page, but the model performance will be evaluated with information retrieval metrics, being the Mean Average Precision (MAP) the official metric of the task, although results will be provided in other metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Precision@K(1,5,10).\nTask B: Job Title-Based Skill Prediction Goal: Develop systems capable of retrieving relevant skills associated with a given job title.\nData: More information about data will be shown in Data section, but essentially we will provide:\nTraining set: A training set of at least 5.000 job titles along with the professional skills required for each position will be provided. This data is sourced from actual job descriptions and semi-automatically curated to ensure high accuracy in the training set.\nDevelopment set: The development set will consist of 200 job titles along with their related skills, normalized to ESCO terminology.\nTest set: The test set comprises a list of 500 job titles. The participants will be required to predict the related skills using the provided gazetteer.\nEvaluation: Details about evaluation will be placed in Evaluation page, but the model performance in this task will be also evaluated with information retrieval metrics, being the Mean Average Precision (MAP) the official metric of the task, although results will be provided in other metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Precision@K(1,5,10).\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" The TalentCLEF 2025 task is structured into two …","ref":"/talentclef/docs/talentclef-2025/task-summary/","tags":"","title":"Task Summary"},{"body":" We take the legal and ethical implications of using AI in Human Resources very seriously.
