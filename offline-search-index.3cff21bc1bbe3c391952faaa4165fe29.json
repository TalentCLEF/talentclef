Dataset files and detailed format specifications will be added here as they are released according to the official schedule. This page contains the corpus information for TalentCLEF 2026 tasks. You can access the link to download in datasets page.\nTask A: Contextualized Job-Person Matching Summary: The Task A corpus consists of job descriptions and résumés (CVs) in two languages: English and Spanish. Documents are synthetically generated from structured data derived from real job descriptions and curricula vitae, preserving realism while protecting privacy. The dataset covers multiple professional domains and sectors, selected via clustering over semantic vector representations to ensure diversity and representativeness.\nSynthetic documents were generated in English and then manually reviewed to ensure quality and internal coherence. Job–candidate matches were annotated by human experts, who determined whether each résumé is suitable for a given job offer. The Spanish version was created through parallel translation using LLMs and validated by human reviewers to ensure semantic consistency and content equivalence across languages.\nData:\nTraining Set:\nNo training set is provided for this task. However, participants are encouraged to use external resources or data from previous TalentCLEF editions if needed for their problem modeling and solution development.\nDevelopment Set:\nFor each language (English and Spanish),the development set is structured into three different components: queries, corpus, and qrels.tsv.\nQueries: A folder containing 10 job description files. Each file is named with its unique identifier (e.g., 1234, 5678), and the file name serves as the q_id for that query.\nCorpus: A folder containing 472 résumé files. Each file is named with its unique identifier (e.g., 1, 2, 3), and the file name serves as the c_id for that corpus document.\nqrels.tsv: This file defines the relationship between the queries and the corpus elements. It does not include a column header, but one is shown here for illustrative purposes:\nq_id: The identifier of the query (corresponding to the query file name). iter: A reserved field (always 0). c_id: The identifier of the corresponding corpus element (corresponding to the corpus file name). relevance: A binary score (0 or 1) indicating the relevance of the corpus element to the query, where 1 signifies relevant and 0 non-relevant. Example structure of qrels.tsv:\nq_id iter c_id relevance 1234 0 1 1 1234 0 5 0 1234 0 12 1 5678 0 2 1 5678 0 8 0 Test Set:\nTask B: Job-Skill Matching with Skill Type Classification Summary:\nThis dataset supports job title–based skill prediction in English across multiple job domains and professional sectors. It includes job titles and associated skills, curated and processed to facilitate training and evaluation for this task.\nParticipants must retrieve the skills from a gazetteer that best match each job title and classify each retrieved skill as core or contextual. Core skills are required to perform a job regardless of employer or work setting (i.e., essential for the role). Contextual skills depend on factors such as the organization, industry, or specific project, and can therefore be considered optional.\nFor example, a software engineer may be required to develop mobile applications in some contexts depending on the product and technical stack, but will generally be expected to write code. In this case, write code is a core skill, while mobile application development is a contextual skill.\nData:\nTraining Set:\nFor generating the training data for Task B, the information available in ESCO has been used. We have prepared the training data in three separate files: job2skill.tsv, jobid2terms.json and skillid2terms.json.\njob2skill.tsv: This file has been curated to include the most representative skills for each job title in ESCO. A filtering process has been applied to the number of skills per job title to avoid outliers.

For each job description in the test set, participants must provide a ranked list of candidate profiles according to their relevance to the position.\nMultilingual: Participants are required to develop systems adapted to English and optionally systems that operate in cross-lingual scenarios involving English and Spanish.\nData: More information about data will be shown in Data section, but we will provide a synthetically generated dataset built from structured resources derived from real job descriptions and résumés, containing no personal information, and without posing privacy risks\nDevelopment Set: Participants will receive a small manually annotated development set of 30 samples per language, consisting of a job description and its list of relevant résumés. A knowledge base of around 100 résumés will also be provided for participants to generate predictions by ranking it.\nTest set: A background set of job offers will be provided. The evaluation, however, will be conducted on a subset of the background set, that will be a gold standard corpus of 50 job offers in each language annotated with the same methodology as the development set.\nEvaluation: Details about evaluation will be placed in Evaluation page, but the model performance will be evaluated with information retrieval metrics, being the Mean Average Precision (MAP) the official metric of the task, although results will be provided in other metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Precision@K(1,5,10).\nTask B: Job-Skill Matching with Skill Type Classification Goal: Develop systems capable of retrieving relevant skills associated with a given job title and additionally classifying each retrieved skill as either core, complementary or transversal.\nData: More information about data will be shown in Data section, but essentially we will provide:\nTraining set: A training set of at least 5.000 job titles along with the professional skills required for each position will be provided.\nDevelopment set: The development set will consist of 200 job titles along with their related skills, normalized to ESCO terminology. The data will include a new annotation layer indicating the relevance of each skill for the job position, specifying whether the skill is considered core or contextual. Core skills are those required to perform a specific job independently of the work context or employer and can thus be seen as essential for the position, whereas contextual skills depend on factors such as the organization or industry and can therefore be seen as optional.\nTest set: The test set comprises a list of 500 job titles. The participants will be required to predict the related skills using the provided gazetteer, but also the skill type classification.\nEvaluation: Details about evaluation will be shared soon in the Evaluation page, but the model performance will be evaluated with information retrieval metrics, such as the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) and Mean Average Precision (MAP), although results will be provided also using other metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Precision@K(1,5,10).\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" The TalentCLEF 2026 task is structured into two …","ref":"/talentclef/docs/talentclef-2026/task-summary/","tags":"","title":"Task Summary"},{"body":" We take the legal and ethical implications of using AI in Human Resources very seriously.

The official competition links will be shared soon through this platform and online communication channels.\nTask A - Codabench rules For Task A, predictions for each language pair must be generated in separate run files. These files should be compressed into a ZIP file, ensuring that the files are placed directly inside the root of the archive (without any folders), and then uploaded to Codabench. During the development phase, participants can submit as many files as they wish in the platform. During the test phase, a maximum of 5 submissions can be uploaded. Each submission is required to contain at least the results for en-en and es-es; otherwise, an evaluation error will appear. We also suggest including cross-lingual predictions (en-es). Uploading rules:\nFile Naming Rules: Run files must follow the naming convention run_xx-xx_teamname.trec, where xx-xx represents the directionality of the queries and corpus elements. ZIP Compression: The Run files should be compressed into a flat ZIP file (i.e., the files must be placed directly inside the ZIP, without folders). Task B - Codabench rules During the development phase, participants can submit as many files as they wish in the platform. During the test phase, a maximum of 3 submissions can be uploaded.
