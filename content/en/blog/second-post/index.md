Last week, on September 12, we presented the TalentCLEF Task at the CLEF2024 conference in Grenoble. This session provided an interesting opportunity to showcase the objectives, structure and expected impact of the task, generating a great deal of interest among researchers and practitioners alike.

The presentation highlighted the various facets of the TalentCLEF Task, including the unique challenges it addresses, the dataset design, and the evaluation criteria that participants will navigate. 


We look forward to further promoting the task to interested participants through our  [TalentCLEF website](https://talentclef.github.io/talentclef/docs/). 

We will be publishing the sample set soon.
