After a year of hard work and great participation, Iâ€™m excited to share that the **first TalentCLEF Workshop** will be held at **#CLEF2025 in Madrid** on **September 11â€“12, 2025** 

TalentCLEF has been an incredible community effort to push forward research on **multilingual HRâ€“NLP solutions** for skill and job title intelligence, tackling real challenges in talent management.  

This yearâ€™s program includes **15 talks** from the teams that took part in the evaluation campaign, showcasing innovative approaches to the tasks we set.  

We are also honored to host a keynote by [**Marios Constantinides (CYENS Centre of Excellence)**](https://comarios.com/), a top researcher in Humanâ€“Computer Interaction, who will discuss how, in a world where AI is rapidly transforming the workplace, emerging technologies can enhance professional collaboration â€” not only by boosting productivity, but also by supporting **emotional awareness, psychological safety, and physical comfort** in hybrid work environments.  

ðŸ‘‰ You can find the full workshop program and other relevant information <a  href='{{< relref "docs/talentclef-2025/workshop/" >}}'> here</a>.


Looking forward to having good discussions and meeting the community in Madrid! ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸
