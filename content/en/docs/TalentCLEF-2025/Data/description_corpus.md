<summary><strong>Task A: Multilingual Job Title Matching Corpus</strong></summary>
<strong>Summary:</strong>

The corpus used for Task A consists of a set of job titles in three languages: English, Spanish and German, from different job domains and professional sectors. These job titles have been collected and processed in order to facilitate the identification and comparison of equivalent titles across languages. 

The training corpus has been generated using public terminologies, ensuring that the job titles are representative of a wide range of job domains and aligned with standard market terminology.

On the other hand, the validation and test corpora have been annotated by domain experts, following well-defined guidelines to ensure consistency and quality of labels. This annotation process, performed with specialized tools, included several stages of quality control to ensure that the labels were accurate and that the annotated titles accurately reflected the relationships between the different languages in a work environment.

<strong>Data:</strong>

1. **Training Set**: 
The training data is provided in a tabular format with three columns:
    - *id*: An ESCO identifier indicating the origin of the pair's job titles.
    - *jobtitle_1*: The first job title in the pair.
    - *jobtitle_2*: A second job title related to *jobtitle_1*.

    Each dataset is provided in separate files for each language involved in the task. The files are named according to the language, with the following format:
    - `taskA_training_en.tsv`: Contains related job titles in English.
    - `taskA_training_es.tsv`: Contains related job titles in Spanish.
    - `taskA_training_de.tsv`: Contains related job titles in German.

    An example of the content of these files is shown below:

    
    | id                                                                                             | jobtitle_1               | jobtitle_2                  |

2. **Validation Set**:
    The validation set is structured into three diferent files: *queries*, *corpus elements* and *q_rels*, and is provided separately for each language.
    - *Queries*: The queries file contains the following fields:
        - *q_id*: A unique identifier for the query.
        - *jobtitle*: The job title used as the query.

    - *Corpus Elements*: The corpus elements file contains the following fields:
        - *c_id*: A unique identifier for each corpus element.
        - *jobtitle*: The job title present in the corpus.

    - *q_rels*: This file maps the relationship between the query and the corpus elements:
        - *q_id*: The identifier of the query.
        - *c_id*: The identifier of the corresponding corpus element.
        - *relevance*: A binary score (0 or 1) indicating the relevance of the corpus element to the query, where 1 signifies relevant and 0 non-relevant.

    We will provide validation set in *english*, *spanish*, *german* and *chinese*.

    Example of the content of these files for english:

The training data is provided in a tabular format with five columns:
    - *job_id*: An ESCO identifier indicating the job titles.
    - *jobtitle*: Job title in the pair.
    - *skill_id*: An ESCO identifier indicating the skill.
    - *skill*: Skill name.
    - *required_skill*: Indicates if the skill is essential for the job. A value of True denotes an essential skill, while False marks it as optional.

    An example of the content of this file is shown below:

    | job_id                                                                 | jobtitle           | skill_id                                                              | skill               | required_skill |
