CLEF focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of information retrieval systems, such as search engines, text and multimedia retrieval systems, and other types of digital information systems. 

Participants in the TalentCLEF workshop are required to submit a short paper detailing the systems they have developed for the task. Accepted submissions will be published in the CLEF 2025 CEUR proceedings.

At least one author from each accepted paper must register for the CLEF conference and present their system in a poster format. Additionally, outstanding participants, selected by the program committee, will have the opportunity to deliver an oral presentation of their work.
