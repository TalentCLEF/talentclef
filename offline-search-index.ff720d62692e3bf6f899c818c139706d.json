Technological advancements, such as task automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI), are reshaping the labor market by creating new roles that demand specialized skills, often difficult to source. The rise of remote hiring, fueled by technological innovation, has expanded the labor market to a global and multilingual scale. Simultaneously, social progress is narrowing ethnic and gender disparities within companies, fostering more inclusive workplaces.\nSimultaneously, there has been rapid progress in the development and deployment of language-based systems, driven in part by the creation of the Large Language Models (LLMs). These advances are revolutioning the use of tecnology in Human Capital Management (HCM) and Human Resources (HR), enabling the generation of systems able to process large volumens of data and facilitate the identification of the best candidates for specific roles based on their resumee information.\nIntegrating language technologies into HCM significantly enhances key areas. In sourcing and hiring, these tools improve candidate matching by analyzing their skills and experience. During onboarding and training, they create personalized learning materials tailored to individual employee needs. For strategic workforce planning, NLP tools predict market skill trends and future company demands. Additionally, in career development, these technologies monitor employee progress, supporting targeted upskilling and reskilling aligned with both organizational goals and personal aspirations.\nDespite all these benefits, the development and implementation of these systems present challenges such as:\nMultilingualism: The global nature of modern workforces means that companies often need to manage employees and candidates who speak multiple languages. This requires language-based systems to not only understand and process various languages accurately but also to maintain the context and cultural nuances inherent in each. Developing systems that effectively handle multiple languages is a complex task that involves significant computational resources and sophisticated NLP techniques.\nFair models: Ensuring fairness and reducing bias is a critical challenge in HCM. These systems can inadvertently perpetuate existing biases present in the data they are trained on, which can affect hiring decisions, employee evaluations, and promotions. Creating fair and unbiased models requires careful data curation, continuous monitoring, and algorithmic adjustments to mitigate biases related to gender, ethnicity, and other social factors.\nCross-Industry Adaptability: NLP systems must be flexible enough to align with the unique requirements, standards, and practices of each sector, from healthcare to technology to retail, ensuring they are effective and relevant in various contexts.\nThe first edition of TalentCLEF aims to develop and evaluate models designed to facilitate three essential tasks:\nFinding/ranking candidates for job positions based on their experience and professional skills. Implementing upskilling and reskilling strategies that promote the coninuous development of workers Detecting emerging skills and skills gaps of importance in organizations.

For each job title in a provided test set, participants must generate a ranked list of similar job titles from a specified knowledge base.\nMultilingual: Participants are required to develop systems adapted to English, Spanish, German, and optionally, Chinese.\nData: More information about data will be shown in Data section, but essentially we will provide:\nTraining Set: A collection of 15,000 pairs of related job titles per language (English, Spanish, and German), each labeled with a concept identifier, will be provided to facilitate the creation of cross-language training samples. No training data will be provided in Chinese, opening the possibility to use different techniques to improve the performance of the models in this language.\nDevelopment Set: Participants will receive a manually annotated evaluation set of 100 samples per language, consisting of a job title and its list of related job titles. A knowledge base of 2,500 job titles in each task language will also be provided for participants to generate predictions by ranking it. Additionally, cross-lingual data will be also released to allow them assess the models’ ability to operate in that scenario.\nTest set: A background set comprising 5,000 job titles will be provided. The evaluation, however, will be conducted on a subset of the background set, that will be a gold standard corpus of 100 job titles in each language annotated with the same methodology as the development set.\nEvaluation: Details about evaluation will be placed in Evaluation page, but the model performance will be evaluated with information retrieval metrics, being the Mean Average Precision (MAP) the official metric of the task, although results will be provided in other metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Precision@K(1,5,10).\nTask B: Job Title-Based Skill Prediction Goal: Develop systems capable of retrieving relevant skills associated with a given job title.\nData: More information about data will be shown in Data section, but essentially we will provide:\nTraining set: A training set of at least 5.000 job titles along with the professional skills required for each position will be provided. This data is sourced from actual job descriptions and semi-automatically curated to ensure high accuracy in the training set.\nDevelopment set: The development set will consist of 200 job titles along with their related skills, normalized to ESCO terminology.\nTest set: The test set comprises a list of 500 job titles. The participants will be required to predict the related skills using the provided gazetteer.\nEvaluation: Details about evaluation will be placed in Evaluation page, but the model performance in this task will be also evaluated with information retrieval metrics, being the Mean Average Precision (MAP) the official metric of the task, although results will be provided in other metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Precision@K(1,5,10).\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" The TalentCLEF 2025 task is structured into two …","ref":"/talentclef/docs/talentclef-2025/task-summary/","tags":"","title":"Task Summary"},{"body":" We take the legal and ethical implications of using AI in Human Resources very seriously.
